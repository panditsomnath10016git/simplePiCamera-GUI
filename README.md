# simplePiCamera-GUI
A mininalistic picamera GUI to take pictures or ~videos~ with Raspberry-Pi.

An effort to make an simple picamera application to take pictures and videos with picamera module in python. Initially it is a script to take only pictures but hopefully I will get time to extend it to take videos and set the different camera parameters.

## Keyboard shortcuts
    - <Escape> to show or hide input panel.
    - <Control+S> to quick-save instantly with default timestamped filename.
    - <Enter> to save with the filename written in the input panel; If the input panel is hidden it works as quick-save.
    - <Control+C> closes the application.
